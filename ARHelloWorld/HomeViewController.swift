//The following code is commented. I tried to make this very easy to follow
//There is a lot of story boarding used so some of the functionality may not be seen in the code.
//Comments should help
//
//MAC and Tyson - Read func1 to see my vision on how the flow would work once we can implement satelliteKit
//
//For the final demo, I will take out the textboxes and have a list of buttons (which would represent different satellits)
